The SquareShift class has main function
There Im getting two inputs.
One contains a 2d array representing the seat grids and the other input has the passenger Id's.
Both Inputs were taken as a string.
Hence I'm Traversing through that string and appending the numbers I found to an array.

Then I have created a class called FillSeats 
From there I link the necessary conditions for filling seats.
I'll be checking for prime numbers and Multiple of 2powern numbers by traversing through the Second Input
Then created a separate array to contain Prime numbers , Multiple of 2 power n numbers and others.
To check whether a number is prime or not and is multiple of 2 power n or not , I have created a separate class and functions inside it.

Then I will be filling the Aisle seats followed by Window seats then Middle seats.
Then Filling the seats accordingly.
